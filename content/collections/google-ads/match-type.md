When choosing keywords, you have some control over how broadly or narrowly they need to match a search query before the ad is triggered. You do this by establishing match types for each keyword. For example, you can choose a broad match for your keyword. With a broad match, the widest variety of keywords will trigger your ad. A broad match keyword “car insurance” might be trigger an ad for a search query “auto coverage.” At the other end of the spectrum is the exact match. With an exact match, the search term must match your keyword exactly, with no misspellings or extra words. For example, if “insurance” were an exact match type, the search query “car insurance” would not trigger your ad. Different match types have different implications for a campaign. Broad match keywords allow for the maximum traffic, because your ad will match the most search queries. On the other hand, more of those queries will be irrelevant to your business, so you might have fewer conversions. An exact match keyword will have much less traffic, but with a greater likelihood that the traffic will be relevant to your business.

### The match types

Let’s review the types of keywords you can select for your Adwords campaign. Below is a chart courtesy of Google that reviews the different keyword match types, ordered from broad to narrow.

**Broad match** Ads may show on searches that include misspellings, synonyms, related searches, and other relevant variations. Example keyword: women's hats Example search: buy ladies hats 

**Broad match modified** Ads may show on searches that contain the modified term (or close variations, but not synonyms), in any order. Example keyword:+women's +hats Example search: hats for women

**Phrase match** Ads may show on searches that contain the keyword phrase, and close variations of that phrase Example keyword:"women's hats" Example search: buy women's hats 

**Exact match** Ads may show on searches that contain are an exact term and close variations of that exact term Example keyword:[women's hats] Example search: women's hats 

**Negative match** Ads may show on searches that do not contain the term. More on negative match in the next section. Example keyword:-women Example search: baseball hats Keep a couple of things in mind. First, keywords aren’t case-sensitive, which means you don’t need to add both Bubble Gum and bubble gum. The same goes for the name of a company or person. John Smith looks the same to Adwords as john smith. Secondly, you can build your keywords in sets for different campaigns and audiences. This is called an Ad group. It is a set of keywords, ads, and bids you manage together.

### Close variations

Even on exact match keywords, Google will show your ads if it considers the search terms a “close variation” of your keywords. Close variations include singular and plural forms, abbreviations, acronyms, accents, and stemmings (such as “roof” vs. “roofing”). There is no need to enter these terms as separate keywords.

### Success by starting small

You’re eager to let people know about your product or service, and you may be tempted to use all broad match keywords. Remember, however, that lots of traffic is not necessarily good traffic. We recommend starting with broad modified keywords, and then using traffic from those keywords to guide your creation of exact match keywords.
