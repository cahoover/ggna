intro: |
  When I started consulting, I expected that the work would be similar to my experience in-house. I would work with the team, provide third-party insight and ideas around marketing strategy, and enjoy working with a wide variety of companies. 
  
  Turned out my clients needed more than strategy. Often, there was no team (or a very small team). They needed help executing. I had to get shit done, and everything needed to be measured, tested, evaluated, and iterated. 
  
  Over the years I had mostly delegated this work, now I had to do it myself. The result was a lot of learning curves. How to build and maintain landing page servers, audit sites for SEO, optimize PPC campaigns, evaluate reviews using natural language processing, conduct sentiment analysis on social networks, perform A/B testing on landing pages, configure Google Tag Manager and Analytics, and on and on. 
  
  Over time I had extensive notes, which I'm moving online. Hopefully it'll be helpful.
