When you set up an AdWords campaign, you tell Google when and where to show the ad. If you like, you can run ads only during certain times of day. You can show ads only to searchers physically located in one small area. Or you can run ads all day long worldwide. More importantly, you also must tell Google what searches should trigger the ad. This is done by selecting keywords and associating them with an ad. When someone types in a search that is a match or a close variation of a keyword, the ad is eligible to be displayed. Ads appear at the top and bottom of Google search results. For example, consider the results page for healthcare. ![](https://blog.adfury.io/wp-content/uploads/image7-281x300.png) As you can see, ads appear at the top and the bottom of the page, with regular search results in between. (These aren’t shown in the image to save space, not because we don’t like regular search results!) Ads on the first page perform better than ads on subsequent pages, and ads toward the top of the page perform better than ads toward the bottom. How much better? A study by online ad network Chitika found that the number one ad spot got almost 33% of the traffic! The top three positions together got more than 60% of ad traffic, and the traffic drops off dramatically from there. **To get a good ad position, focus on quality** You’re not the only one bidding on common keywords. Many different advertisers compete to get a good position for their ad. Google has to choose which ones to show, and in which order. It does this by first calculating the ads that are most relevant to the search by calculating something called a Quality Score. Relevance is important. It’s difficult to place a low-quality ad on AdWords simply by paying more money. The quality of search results, including ads, is paramount to Google. If search results were low quality, people would stop using Google altogether. To be successful using AdWords you must take care that the ads you show, and the websites they link to, are relevant to the search term. Google takes each advertiser’s Quality Score, multiplies it by the bid amount, and uses the product of that calculation to place ads on the results page. We’ll get into the specifics of Quality Score and the bid process below. For now just understand that quality matters, and a poorly managed campaign is likely to perform poorly. **Ad format** AdWords ads all follow a particular format. Consider this ad: ![](https://blog.adfury.io/wp-content/uploads/image3-300x80.png) It’s composed of a number of specific sections, helpfully illustrated here: ![](https://blog.adfury.io/wp-content/uploads/image10-300x64.png) These sections are:

1.  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Two headline fields (up to 30 characters each), divided by a hyphen</span>
2.  <span style="font-weight: 400;">A URL. The part between the “www” and the “com” (aka the root domain) must match the root domain of the website linked to the ad, but the part between the slashes (the paths) can be up to 15 characters and don’t have to match.</span>
3.  <span style="font-weight: 400;">A description field that takes up to two rows and can be up to 80 characters long. A</span>
4.  <span style="font-weight: 400;">The second description field.  that takes up to two rows and can be up to 80 characters long. Although it’s a single field, many advertisers use the two links for different messages.</span>
5.  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ad extension. Optional, and placed at the bottom of the ad. Site extensions add information to the ads in various ways. They’re discussed below.</span>
6.  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Another ad extension. Available ad extensions let you include customer reviews, phone numbers, additional links, locations, and more.</span>
