<span style="font-weight: 400;">To conduct a successful AdWords campaign, it’s helpful to understand the elements that make up a campaign. These elements are briefly described in this section, with an in-depth description provided later on.</span> These are the ingredients of a campaign. Clever, right? ![](https://blog.adfury.io/wp-content/uploads/cooking-ingredient-cuisine-kitchen.jpg)

### Keywords

Keywords tell Google which search terms should trigger your ad. You do this by associating keywords with your ad. Keywords and search queries are related, but they aren’t exactly the same thing. Keywords do not need to match the search query directly. Even if the phrasing is different, your ad may still come up if it is similar to the keywords. If you use “Virginia real estate,” for example, your ad may appear in searches for “Virginia properties” or “real estate near DC.” How closely your keyword needs to match the search query is controlled by keyword match type. Which brings us to...

### Match type

For each keyword you use in your campaign, you must assign a match type. The match type controls how close your keyword has to be to the search term for your ad to show. Example match types include broad match, which allows synonyms, common misspellings, and other slight variations to bring the ad up. Exact match keywords, on the other hand, require the searcher to type the keyword exactly before the ad is triggered. If you use the keyword “mens shoes,” for example, your site may come up in a search for “blue suede shoes” if it’s a broad match, but not if it’s an exact match.

### Negative keywords

A negative keyword defines when your ad should _**not**_ be shown. When you use a negative keyword with an ad, the ad will not be shown if that keyword is entered as any part of a search. Negative keywords are often overlooked, but they are essential for maintaining high quality real estate campaigns. For example, negative keywords help you specify where your business is located and where they are not. Say you service people in North Carolina but not in South Carolina. You could enter “South” and “SC” as negative keywords, so people looking for services in the South don’t assume they can get it from you. In addition, negative keywords help prevent you ads from being associated with undesirable events and phenomena. If one of your keywords is hotel, for example, you wouldn’t want your company to show up on searches for “hotels with bedbugs,” “dirty hotels,” or “noisy hotels” You can thus enter “bedbugs,” “dirty,” and “noisy” as negative keywords. Finding the right negative keywords takes time, requiring you to pay close attention to which searches launch your ad. Whenever you see a query that you don’t want associated with your firm, you can expand your negative keywords.

### Location Targeting

Location targeting causes your ads to be triggered only by people searching in or about certain locations. This is essential in some forms of advertising. For example, in real estate advertising location targeting ensure your leads are relevant to you, and helps prevent paying for traffic looking for real estate outside your service area. You can choose entire countries, states and provinces, cities, or even neighborhoods.

### Device Targeting

Just as location targeting causes your ads to appear only for searchers in a particular location, device targeting causes your ads to appear only for searchers using specific device types. Using device targeting helps you build campaigns with advertisements specific to one device or another. For example, you might want your advertisement to feature a phone number for people using a mobile device and a form for people using a desktop.

### Ad Structure

Last year Google introduced a new ad format, called “expanded” ads. Expanded ads perform better on mobile devices and are now standard style for all Google ads. They look like this: ![](https://blog.adfury.io/wp-content/uploads/Ad.png) This ad is made up of various elements ![](https://blog.adfury.io/wp-content/uploads/Expanded.png)

*   The **headline** contains two sections, separated by a hyphen. Each headline can contain up to 30 characters.
*   A **URL** that points to a web page.
*   A **description** field that may contain up to 80 characters.
*   **Extensions**, such as additional links. In the ad above “Amenities” “Floor plans” etc. are extensions.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">A note on the ad URL</span>: In the ad above the URL is displayed as “www.bayshoregrovemiami.com,” but you have some flexibility around where the URL actually goes. For example, clicking this URL might take you to a web site at “lp.bayshoregrovemiami.com/apartments” **The root domain of the URL (bayshoregrovemiami.com) must be the same on the ad as on the page the ad points to.** <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A note on extensions</span>: Ad extensions are extra information you can include in your ad. They don't directly cost anything, but they can increase your click through rate, thereby raising the campaign's cost. Remember, what matters in search advertising isn’t the number of clicks you receive, but how many people “convert,” or engage with your business.

### Writing Ads

It's both an art and science to write compelling ad copy. There's a blog post on [best practices for writing compelling ads](https://blog.adfury.io/blog/writing-ad-variations/).

### Landing pages

A “landing page” is the web site that appears when someone clicks on your ad. Creating an engaging, memorable landing page is every bit as important as designing the ads themselves. The better your page, the more likely a click is to become a lead. Landing pages should make heavy use of images that give customers a vivid idea of what your service is all about. They should also contain specific, verifiable information that is broken up with bullet points and headers, so that visitors have an easier time getting through and understanding the text. Use the landing page to expand on selling points first mentioned in the ad, and end with a call to action that encourages the reader to make a purchase.

### Using your home page as a landing page

Research has shown that landing pages perform almost 40% better if they reflect the keywords and copy in the ads. For all but the smallest businesses, the homepage is too general and won’t exactly reflect the ad copy. So, don’t point your ads to your home page. Landing pages are much more effective if they match the ad. This means you should have a specific landing page to accompany every ad. Don’t worry, AdFury provides the tools and guidance to help you quickly produce all the pages you need.

### Quality score

Google assigns every ad something called a “Quality Score.” This score ranges from 1 (the worst) to 10 (the best). A Quality Score is Google’s way of measuring how relevant your ads will be to searchers. If you have a good Quality Score, your ads will appear in better positions and will cost less. If you have a bad Quality Score, Google might refuse to run your ads at all, no matter how much you are willing to pay. Obviously it’s important to maintain as high a Quality Score as possible. Relevant ad copy and good landing pages are the two important contributors to quality score.

### Bids and budget

When someone searches, Google must decide which ads to place in the results and in what order. To do this, Google conducts an auction and assigns your ads something called the adrank score. This score is based on combining your Quality Score and the amount you bid during the auction. The auction process is complex, more information can be found in the appropriate section.

### Campaign organization

AdWords organizes ads in a hierarchy. Ads are grouped together into Ad Groups. Ad Groups are grouped together into Campaigns. Campaigns are grouped together in Campaign Groups. A good organization strategy is important for keeping track of ad performance, budgeting, and testing. Details on some organization strategies are described elsewhere, but in generation you want to group similar keywords and their associated ads together. The more effectively you link ads to relevant keywords, the better your campaign will perform.

### Reporting and measuring

Monitoring performance is essential to any campaign. AdWords provides data you can’t find anywhere else. You can monitor ad performance by location, keyword, device, headlines, messages, and offers. By monitoring these results and adjusting your strategy accordingly, you can continuously improve your campaign.

### Test and iterate

AdWords requires constant attention and innovation for success. You must frequently try out new keywords, experiment with different ad copy, and enhance your landing pages, always striving to improve your performance.
