Perhaps stating the obvious; in AdWords, everything begins when someone types a search term into Google. The results generated by Google consist of both paid results (advertisements) and regular search results (called “organic” results). So far so good. In search results, relevance is king. In the ancient days before Google search engines were -- at best -- hit and miss. No one wins if a user types “raincoat” into the search engine and sees results featuring cement and dentists. To Google, the most important quality of any search result, paid or not, is relevance.

### A keyword connects an ad to a search query

The keyword is how you connect your ad to a search query that someone types into Google. It’s important to understand the difference between a keyword and a search query.

*   A **keyword** is a word or phrase that you place in your account.
*   A **search query** is what a person actually types into Google.

For example, you might buy the keyword “car insurance” and find that your ad is triggered by search queries like “auto coverage.” Here are some ad results for the search term “auto coverage.” Their campaigns all use the keyword “auto insurance.” ![](https://blog.adfury.io/wp-content/uploads/image5.png)

### Rely on keyword research

Because keywords are so essential to your campaign’s success, make sure to research them in detail. AdFury’s research tool makes it easy to identify large numbers of relevant keywords before each campaign. Simply type in a keyword you know is relevant to your real estate business and we'll list all related terms and phrases. Remember that keyword research is a never-ending process. The market is always changing, as are consumers’ search habits and methods; the keywords that work today may not be much use in the near future. You should thus regularly research new terms and phrases and update your campaigns accordingly.

### Avoid duplicate keywords

For each campaign, be careful to use only one keyword per match type. Duplicate keywords will cause your ads to compete with each other for search results, undermining the entire campaign. AdFury’s account audit tools can identify duplicate terms and other errors that may make your ads less effective.

### Use match type thoughtfully

We often see campaigns using keywords configured only with the default match type, which means that the ad is triggered for broadest set of search queries. This has the benefit of increasing your ad traffic. But it also increases the amount of irrelevant traffic -- people that have no chance of becoming customers. Don’t pay for this kind of traffic. Make sure you understand and apply strategies around match type (discussed in the next section).
