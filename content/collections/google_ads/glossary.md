##### Account

Refers to a business relationship with Google's AdWords service. An AdWords account is required for the AdFury Service. Signing up for Google AdWords and launching campaigns is free. You only pay when someone clicks your ad to visit your website, or calls you.

##### Ad Delivery

A setting that determines how quickly you want Google to use your budget each day: either spread throughout the day (standard) or more quickly (accelerated). This setting affects when during the day your ads are likely to show, especially if your campaigns are limited by budget.

##### Ad Extensions

Additional incentives that increase the likelihood that users will click your ads. Advertisers can include business addresses and phone numbers, additional site links, or specific product information.

##### Ad Group

A set of keywords, ads, and bids that is a key part of how your account is organized. Each campaign is made up of one or more ad groups, while each ad group typically includes about 5-10 keywords.

##### Ad Position

The order in which your ad appears on a page in relation to other paid ads. An ad position of “1” means that your ad is the first ad on a page. Position one doesn’t mean that you are on top of the organic results necessarily. You can be in position one while appearing on the side of the results.

##### Ad Rank

Not to be confused with Ad Position, Ad Rank is a value that Google uses to determine your ad position. It's calculated as the product of your bid and Quality Score. The higher your Ad Rank, the better your ad will perform.

A preference that determines which ad in your ad group should show when you have multiple ads active. Rotation settings include

*   Optimize for Clicks,
*   Optimize for Conversions,

This setting is important to check to ensure that you have a proper balance between testing of your messaging and performance of your account.

A campaign strategy based on creating "beta” campaigns that use broad match to find new keywords, and a set of corresponding “alpha” campaigns containing exact match keywords with a proven performance record.

##### Advertising Policies

##### Broad Match Modifier (BMM)

Keyword setting that allows advertisers to control how search terms trigger (or don't trigger) their ads. A modifier narrows the scope of keywords for which your ad is shown. Unlike broad match, using a modifier excludes synonyms or related searches. Using broad match modifier is a good choice if you want to increase relevancy even if it means you might get less ad traffic than broad match. The modifier is indicated by plus sign (+) added to your broad match keywords, and indicates that the ads should show show when someone searches for close variants of your keywords in any order. Close variants include misspellings, singular/plural forms, abbreviations and acronyms.

##### Call Extensions

Feature that enables users to display a Google forwarding or business phone number along with their ad.

##### Default Max. CPC

The max CPC ("cost per click") is the maximum amount your are willing to bid for a keyword. You can set a specific bid at the keyword level. Oftentimes, however, it's unwieldy to assign a bid for every keyword in a campaign. In this case, you set a default max CPC at the ad group level, and AdWords will apply it to keywords that don't have a specific bid assigned.

##### Destination URL

The URL address for the page you’re sending traffic to from your ads, as distinguished from the Display URL (see below). This is allowed to be different from the display URL, although it has to direct users to the same domain as what is in the display URL.

Long tail keywords can be effective marketing tools because they are generally cheaper than popular keywords, and can focus messages to a very specific audience.

##### Manual Bidding

A bidding option in which ad bids are explicitly defined for a particular keyword, placement, etc. Automatic Bidding are a common alternative when explicit settings are not needed.

Also known as a “search terms report”, this report details which search queries triggered a PPC ads.
