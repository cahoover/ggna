A "landing page" is a website that appears after an ad is clicked. When someone enters a search, they are asking for information. The ad tells the searcher where they can find that information. The landing page delivers.

### Landing page performance and your budget

Because AdWords charges most campaigns per click, you have to pay every time a user selects your ads, regardless of what you do afterwards. This means that if your landing page isn’t compelling, you’ll waste money on clicks that lead to no sales. You should thus invest every bit as much time and effort into the landing page that you put into selecting keywords, writing ads, and testing ads.

### The recipe for landing page success

#### Show, don't tell

Instead of stating that customers will enjoy your business, make them picture themselves enjoying it. Vivid images and videos of your business will get their imaginations going, suggesting that they will appreciate the purchase without directly saying anything. If they come to this conclusion on their own, they’re more likely to decide that yours is the right business to work with. When you do use words, cite specific statistics rather than making general claims. For example, if you’re making a point about the high quality and low maintenance costs of your product, don’t just say “Homeowners spend thousands of dollars repairing and maintaining their homes.” Instead, go with something like, “the typical $300,000 home requires $3,000 a year to maintain.” Specific information shows that you are an authority, making readers more likely to trust you.

#### Stay on point

Make sure that everything you show and tell on your site is directly related to your keywords and fulfills the likely purpose of the search. The closer your landing page matches what users are searching for, the more likely those users are to read and remember the entire page. Part of staying on point means using the keywords directly in your landing page's copy. According to a recent study, landing pages that used the exact keyword received almost 40 percent more conversions than otherwise-similar pages that used a generic version of the keyword.

#### Guide your reader

Construct your landing page so that viewers will have an easy time understanding and navigating it. Use clear, simple language, short paragraphs, and frequent subheadings and bullet points. Break written content up periodically with relevant images, and end with a call to action suggesting that readers should make a purchase. Don’t give them any way to exit the site other than closing the tab or clicking the call to action.

#### Emphasize your benefits

We mentioned that the ad copy should include information that makes your properties unique. The landing page is an opportunity to expand on this information. Go into detail about the specific positive features of your business.Try to include such information in bullet points or short, distinct paragraphs so that it is easy to absorb.

#### Social proof

Testimonials from happy customers is a powerful way to describe your business, because they represent an impartial third party experience of your business. Include them as long as they are genuine and directly relevant to the people your page is serving. If possible, try to include pictures of the people in the testimonials, as this will reinforce their validity and make the content more relate-able. If for whatever reason you don’t have strong testimonials, don’t make them up. It’s easy to see through fake social proof. Using it can do a lot of damage to your brand.
