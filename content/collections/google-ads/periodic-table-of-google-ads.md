## Market

 Taking time to understand your customer and the intent behind their searches will help you design a more relevant and better performing campaign. 

### Mc: Customer

 You should take the time to understand who your customer is, what problems they are trying to solve, and how you can help solve those problems. Without this understanding it’s very difficult to use AdWords strategically by advertising to specific traffic types, and it’s very difficult to maintain relevancy in your ads. Your performance will suffer, and you’ll pay more to advertise. 

### Mj: Journey

 Most products are not purchased in a single step. Customers move through a series of decision points on their way to a purchase, from exploring options (“fun ideas for bridesmaids parties New Orleans”), to narrowing possibilities (“bridesmaids boat party New Orleans”), to selecting an option (“boat party coupon code New Orleans New Orleans”). Understanding this journey lets you target advertising specifically relevant to each step. 

### Mp: Psychology

 When you’re planning an AdWords campaign, it’s helpful to understand the psychology behind the search; the searcher’s _intent_. People don’t aimlessly search within Google Do they want to buy something? Learn about something? Go somewhere? By understanding and addressing the searcher’s goal, you can build ads that are more relevant and thus will perform better. 

## Keywords

 Keywords are the foundation of your search campaign. Don’t just rely on your gut — spend time to research keywords, and keep tabs on their performance as your campaign progresses. 

### Kr: Research

 Keyword research is an essential step within any AdWords campaign. Don’t rely on your gut. Use a keyword research tool to discover related queries, and pay attention to search queries while your campaign is active. You will find queries that you’ve never thought of, hidden gems that you can target with a exact match keyword and hyper relevant ad copy. 

### Km: Match type

 Keyword match type helps you select whether you want your ad to be triggered on broad variations of your keyword (more traffic but a higher proportion of less relevant traffic). On the other hand, you can trigger only on your keyword exactly (less traffic but higher relevance). This article [talks more about keyword match type](https://blog.adfury.io/adwordsmatchtype/). 

### Kn: Negatives

 Negative keywords are vital in AdWords, but are often overlooked. They tell Google when _not_ to trigger an ad. This allows you to carve out unwanted or irrelevant traffic. This article talks [more about negative keywords.](https://blog.adfury.io/adwordsnegativekeywords/) 

### Kf: Funnel

 When you understand who your customer is, you should also understand the stages they take toward a purchase (i.e. where they are in the sale funnel). Are they making a general search (“best widgets”) or more specific (“Bob’s widgets price”). By mapping keywords to stages in the funnel, you can target your ads and your landing pages to match exactly what they need at a particular stage. 

## Ads

 The more relevant your ad copy is to the searcher, the more clicks you will get. Make sure you thoughtfully craft your ads, follow Google’s editorial guidelines, and constantly test everything. 

### Av: Variations

 Testing variations of your ad copy is also important. Each of your ad groups should have at least two ads within it at all times, preferably three or four. In this way you are always testing and optimizing your ad copy, ensuring you are always on top of what works (and eliminating what doesn’t). Check out this article for [some ideas about writing ad variations.](https://blog.adfury.io/writingadvariations/) (https://blog.adfury.io/writingadvariations/). 

### Ag: Guidelines

 [Google’s editorial guidelines for ad copy](https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/6021546?visit_id=1636518231126329757679210201&rd=1) is important to understand. Violating it ensures your ad will be disapproved and you’ll waste time and effort. Rules aren’t limited to ad copy either, as the URL displayed in the ad must match the URL in the link. 

### Ak: Keywords

 The keyword is how you connect your ad to a search query that someone types into Google. It’s important understand the difference, and the fundamental role that keywords play in your campaign. If you need a primer, [this article can help you learn about keywords](https://blog.adfury.io/adwordskeywords/). 

### Ah: Hyperbole

 Google explicitly forbids many aspects of hyperbolic ad copy, including ALL CAPS, the use of exclamation points, phone numbers, and repetitive words that declare your product the best, best, best!!! This doesn’t mean you are forced to write dry lifeless copy, but you’ll need to be creative and find that perfect “goldilocks” copy in that justright area between toodry and over the top. 

### Ae: Extensions

 You should use ad extensions in all your campaigns. They improve ad performance, improve Quality Score, extend your footprint within the SERP, and they’re free. This article provides [an overview of ad extensions](https://blog.adfury.io/introducingadwordsextensions/). 

### Ad: DKI

 Ads tend to perform better if copy matches the search query. Dynamic keyword insertion helps this happen by automatically inserting the keyword into the ad copy. Use with caution to ensure the generated ad makes sense. You can learn more in [[this article about DKI](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2454041?hl=en). 

### Aa: Automation

 Adwords offers a number of options to automate the content of ads. You can dynamically [customize ads using spreadsheet data](https://blog.adfury.io/adcustomizers/). You can [dynamically change ad copy based on users or devices](https://blog.adfury.io/dynamicadcopy/). You need to be careful using copy automation because results can be unexpected, but used correctly they are a powerful way to improve variety and relevance. 

## Landing pages

 Many advertisers just point ads to a generic corporate home page and hope for the best. This is a moneywasting mistake. You’ve already paid for the click on the ad, now is the time to do everything you can to ensure you get a return on that investment. 

### Lt: Test

 Marketing is not a setitandforgetit activity. You should always test variations of landing pages and constantly iterate to maximize performance. Test different page copy, images, length, calls to action, and typography. 

### Ld: Design

 You should consider (and test) the main aspects of design in your landing page: typography (fonts), white space, colors, images, and balance. There’s lots of good resources to help with this, such as landing page templates available through AdFury. Even the length of your landing page matters; short and sweet in most cases, longer for more complex offerings. 

### Lm: Mobile

 A “responsive” landing page means one that looks just as good on a mobile device as it does on a desktop. It’s important to test your landing page on all devices, because responsive landing pages are proven to boost ROI. AdFury landing pages are fully responsive across desktop, tablets, and mobile phones. 

### La: CTA

 Every landing page needs a clear calltoaction to compel visitors to take the all important next step and convert. Of all the things to test, this is among the most important. Small changes in the call to action can cause significant improvements in conversion rate. 

### Ln: Navigation

 You don’t want to include a standard navigation header on your landing page, they’ll just invite people to bounce away from the call to action! If you are collecting lead information, be sure and include a link to your privacy policy, or QS may suffer. 

## Organization

 Adwords provides many organizational levels, grouping keywords and ads into ad groups, ad groups into campaigns, and campaigns into campaign groups. This can seem overwhelming at first, but there are some simple rules of thumb that make it easier to keep your account well organized and humming. 

### Og: Goals

 The organization and configuration of your campaign should reflect the goals you have for your Adwords investment. Do you want more impressions? More leads? More conversions? Knowing what you want to achieve makes it possible to measure and iterate toward success. 

### Oc: Campaigns

 A rule of thumb is to create separate campaigns for items with different business value. Doing this helps clarify the ROI of the campaigns and makes it easier to allocate budget. For example, you probably don’t want to advertise a $10k product and a $100 product in the same campaign. They have different lead ROI and different strategic implications for your company. 

### Oa: Ad groups

 Ad groups contain your keywords and ads. A best practice to follow is to organize ad groups _tightly_, with very similar keywords combined within an ad group and ads created especially for those keywords. In this way you maximize your ad’s relevance 

### Os: Skags

 Single keyword ad groups (or SKAGs) is a popular campaign organization technique in which you including only a single keyword in each ad group. This article talks [more about SKAGs](https://blog.adfury.io/singlekeywordadgroups/). This provides for absolute maximum level of relevance for each ad, because you can craft the ad to speak very specifically to the keyword. The challenge is that it’s more time consuming to build SKAGs, a task [AdFury makes easier with automatic SKAG creation](https://adfury.io/campaignbuilder). 

### Ob: Alpha/beta

 The alpha/beta campaign is a technique that uses two campaigns, one with broad keywords to generate keyword ideas, and one narrowly targeted toward winning keywords. This article tells you [all about how to use alpha/beta](https://blog.adfury.io/alphabetacampaigns/). 

## Settings

 Google provides lots of knobs and switches for your AdWords account. Here are some of the most important. 

### Sb: Bid options

 Every single time someone searches, Google performs an auction to determine which ads will appear in the results page and in what order. You can use bids strategically within searches to optimize for your marketing goals, for different types of traffic, or both. For more information [see this article on bidding](https://blog.adfury.io/adwordsbids/). 

### Sd: Budget

 If bidding determines how much you are willing to spend per click, your budget determines how much you are willing to spend overall. Set at the campaign level, it’s important to monitor budget because its easy to miss search opportunities if you run out of budget prematurely. For more information, [see this article on budget](https://blog.adfury.io/adwordsbids/). 

### Sl: Location

 AdWords allows you to target traffic from a specific location (or locations), which can be important depending on your business. If you run a restaurant in Austin, you might not want to advertise to people in Alaska unless they are specifically searching for restaurants in Austin. This article has [more information on locations in Adwords](https://blog.adfury.io/adwordslocations/). 

### Sm:Device

 AdWords allows you to target traffic from specific devices, which allows you to run devicespecific “call only” style ads or text message links. Some businesses such as real estate agents see mobile traffic as particularly valuable as they work to capture the attention of searchers out and about in their area. [See this article for targeting devices](https://blog.adfury.io/dynamicadcopy/). 

### Su: User lists

 In AdWords, you can create “user lists” made up of people that share certain characteristics and target your advertising specifically to them. You can create user lists of people who have visited your web site, which provides for a powerful way to specifically target people further down your sales tunnel. [See this article for more information on targeting users lists](https://blog.adfury.io/dynamicadcopy/). 

## Measure

 An AdWords rule of thumb is to test everything all the time, and to do that you need to keep your eye on metrics. Here are some of the most important. 

### Mt: Track

 Conversion tracking is one of the most important metrics for lead generation marketers. When a user performs a desired action, such as submitting their name and email address or making a call, it’s called a conversion. Conversions are the name of the game in lead generation advertising. See this article for more [information on conversion tracking.](https://blog.adfury.io/adwordsconversiontracking/) 

### Mr: Reports

 The easiest way to keep tabs on your AdWords performance is to cause a report to be sent to you regularly via email. There are a number of ways to do this, including directly through your AdFury dashboard or from [within AdWords](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/6201327?co=ADWORDS.IsAWNCustomer%3Dfalse&hl=en). 

### Mq: QS

 Quality Score is how Google measures the relevance of your ad (and the ad’s landing page) in relation to the keywords that trigger it. The less relevant your ad and landing page, the lower your Quality Score. If your Quality Score gets low enough, your ads won’t run no matter how much you bid on them. See this article for [more information on Quality Score](https://blog.adfury.io/adwordsqualityscore/). 

### Mc: CTR

 Your click through rate is the ratio of ad impressions vs. ad clicks. CTR is important because Google uses it as a measure of your ad’s relevance, which impacts your Quality Score. If you have a low CTR, you should take a look at the ad and make sure that the copy is both relevant to the search and has something meaningful and differentiated to say. If you have a low rank, take a look at your bids and make sure they are sufficient for a good position. 

### Mv: Conversions

 Conversion rate is where your investment in AdWords generates return. If you have a strong impression share and solid CTR with low conversions, you’re not accomplishing much more than sending money to Google. Low conversions means that the ad was relevant to the search, but the landing page didn’t fulfill the promise of the ad. You need to adjust one or the other to better align the promise with the delivery. 

### Ms: ROAS

 The Return on Ad Spend is the ratio of revenue generated from your AdWords investment relative to the amount spent. You want this ratio to be positive. If it isn’t, your investment is losing money and you should take strong measures to understand why and fix any issues as quickly as possible. 

### Ml: Lin/Rodnitzky ratio

 A quick and easy way to monitor the health of your accounts list he Lin/Rodnitzky ratio. This ratio is a measure of your **overall account cost per conversion vs. cost per conversion of converting search queries**. The higher your L/N ratio, the more money you are spending on search queries that don’t convert. On the other hand, an L/N ration of 1 means that every search query is converting. You want to target your L/N to about 1.5 to 2\. Lower, and your account is too conservative. You’re probably missing queries you didn’t think of. Higher, and you’re too aggressive. You’re paying for irrelevant traffic. See this article for [more information on the Lin/Rodnitzky ratio.](https://3qdigital.com/whitepaper/thelinrodnitzkyratioformeasuringsemhealth)
