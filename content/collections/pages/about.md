intro: |
  When I started consulting, I figured the work would be similar to my experience in-house. I would help with marketing strategy, and get the benefit of working with a wide variety of companies. 
  
  But my clients needed more than strategy. They needed help executing. I had to get shit done, and everything needed to be measured, tested, evaluated, and iterated. 
  
  Over the years I had delegated much of this work to a team, now I had to do it myself. The result was a lot of learning curves. How to build and maintain landing page servers, audit sites for SEO, optimize PPC campaigns, evaluate reviews using natural language processing, conduct sentiment analysis on social networks, perform A/B testing on landing pages, configure Google Tag Manager and Analytics, and on and on. 
  
  Over time I had extensive notes, which I'm moving online. Hopefully it'll be helpful.
