AdWords Extensions are additional pieces of extra information that you can tack onto your ads, such as an address, phone number, or links to different sections of your web site. - Here’s an example of one type of extension, called sitelinks. They are in the red box below the ad in the image below. The sitelink extension lets you add links to your site (optionally with a brief description). There are many different types of extension, and we’ll go through all of them. - ![](https://blog.adfury.io/wp-content/uploads/SiteLinkExtensions.png) -

### Why should you use ad extensions

It’s simple: campaigns with extensions perform better. - Extensions are proven to increase click through rate (CTR). Google data shows that adding ad extensions can immediately increase ad traffic up to 15%. - Perhaps for this reason, Google has confirmed that simply adding relevant ad extensions can immediately improve your Quality Score. -

### When not to use ad extensions

Relevance and quality is just as important with ad extensions as with the ads themselves. Thoughtless creating low quality extensions can hurt performance. Wait until you have some time to plan before you create extensions. Don’t just throw them up if you don’t have time to think them through. - A note on that: don’t go crazy and rely on extensions for the most important and relevant information. Put that in the body of the ad. Why? Simple: Google won’t always show your extensions. - That said, extensions are free to include with your advertising, and they can improve the performance of your ads. Using them is almost always a good idea. -

### General Recommendations

What’s true for landing pages and ads is true for extensions also: test everything. It’s easy and painless to test and iterate extensions. Set a bunch of extensions up and use the change histor report to track which ones contribute the most to performance. - Because extensions can improve your Quality Score, it’s best to keep them even if using them results in a higher cost per click. (This can happen if the extension improves your ad position). If you need to manage costs, reduce your bids instead of removing your extensions. - Make a particular effort to build quality extensions for your mobile campaigns. Extensions, especially call extensions, can improve mobile ad performance significantly. -

### Automatic vs manual extension

There’s two different types of ad extension. A manual extension is created by you, like a phone number or business address. A automatic extension is automatically created by Google, and can include information about your business from Google’s customer surveys. - Google may add automatic extensions to your ad unless you explicitly opt out of them. We suggest you do opt out. It means extra work for you creating the extensions, but gives you much more control over messaging.
