AdWords is Google's advertising service. Through it, a business can display ads in Google's search results when someone makes a relevant search. It's cost effective because you don't pay to display your ad. You only pay when someone clicks on your ad. 

To use AdWords and advertise on Google, you need to first set up a Google AdWords account. Begin this process by pointing your browser to https://www.google.com/adwords/

Go ahead and click on the "start" button. You can enter the email address and and password associated with your Google account (or, if you don't have a Google account, you can create one).

You will be asked to go through a couple of checks and balances, like verifying your email address.  After that, there are only a couple more steps and we promise you will be set!
 
Payment options

You can choose to either prepay or postpay your AdWords account.
<strong>Postpay</strong> – as the name suggestions, you are billed after advertising costs are incurred. You'll need to enter a credit or debit card, and you'll be ready to advertise immediately after authorization.  It's no problem if you prefer to pay directly from a bank account, but this might take a bit longer to approve.
<strong>Prepay</strong> – you can also opt to pay in advance. Deposit an amount of your choice into your account and Google will notify you when your funds are running low. The same payment methods are available.
