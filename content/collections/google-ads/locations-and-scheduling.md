Targeting your ads so that they only appear if a searcher is in a particular physical location enables you to refine your ads' appeal. Instead of competing with all companies for the attention of all potential buyers, you will only be targeting a select subset of high-potential buyers. This can improve your click-thru rate and the campaign's overall effectiveness. -

### Ad scheduling

In addition to choosing the keywords that will trigger your ads, you can also specify when and where your ads should be shown. AdWords allows you to set certain times of the day when your ads will run. You can also cater to searchers’ locations, making those searching from a certain city or state more likely to see the ads. -

### Location targeting

To maximize the effectiveness and minimize the risks of geographical targeting, consider where potential buyers live. Many won’t currently be in your business’ location, but may visit there from other places. If you manage hotels in Miami, for example, and large numbers of people from Ohio are searching for things like “hotels in Miami,” you may want to include Ohio in your geographical targets. Likewise, estimate the time of day when potential customers are likely to look for your business. If they tend to search shortly after they finish their workdays, for example, targeting searches between 5 PM and 8 PM will yield better results.
