You can use the Google advertising platform to place advertisements on many sites across the internet, not just in Google Search. This opportunities for placing ads is called the Google Network. 

The Google network can be divided into two groups, the search network and the display network. -

## Google search network

The **search network** is a collection of web sites that provide search tools. Of course this includes Google Search, but it also includes Google Maps, Google Groups, and Google Shopping. - Here's an image. It's a helpful stylized search results page with the ad positioning highlighted: - ![](https://blog.adfury.io/wp-content/uploads/searchNetwork.png) -

## Search network partner sites

The search network also Â includes Google partner sites, which are non-Google properties that work with Google for search and advertising capabilities. Google does not make public the sites that make up the partner network. -

## The display network

The Google **display network** is a collection of over 2 million websites and apps in which your advertisement can appear, including Google properties such as Blogger and Gmail. These advertisements include a headline and text, just like search advertisements, but also include media such as images or video. - Here's a stylized image of a webpage, with a sidebar advertisement highlighted with a border. That's an example of the display network. - The important takeaway is that the ad you use in search results doesn't work in the display network. It's best to manage display network campaigns separately so you don't get things mixed up. - ![](https://blog.adfury.io/wp-content/uploads/displayNetwork.jpg)
