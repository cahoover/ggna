Not too many people know about _embedded negatives_ in AdWords, much less how to use them. Which is a shame, because they are among the more powerful tools available to discover long tail keywords while simultaneously optimizing for high-volume keywords.

## What you'll learn in this post

This post will describe a powerful technique to attract exactly the traffic you want for your ad.

*   Attract long tail search traffic for your ads
*   Quickly and easily eliminate irrelevant traffic
*   Iterate to improve your traffic profile
*   A bonus use case

## Introduction

The basic concept is simple: you place a broad match keyword and a negative exact match keyword in the same ad group. family lawyer -[family lawyer] Look at that. You're adding a keyword and negating the same keyword _simultaneously_. ![mind-blown](https://blog.adfury.io/wp-content/uploads/boom.gif) What gives? Well, you know that broad-match keywords will trigger ads for a broad range of search queries. The exact match negative will stop the ad from triggering for that specific search query only. By placing a broad-match keyword and an exact-match-negative keyword in the same ad group, you are generating traffic that's similar (but not identical) to the broad match keyword. This ad group becomes your channel for long-tail keywords.

## What about traffic from the base keyword?

It's possible, even likely, that you don't want to lose traffic from your core keyword. Using the example above, you want traffic from "family lawyer." No problem. Create two additional ad groups and place an exact match keyword in one and phrase match in the other. Now you have three ad groups:

1.  **Ad group one**: family lawyer -[family lawyer]
2.  **Ad group two**: [family lawyer]
3.  **Ad group three**: "family lawyer"

Now you've got ad group one exploring the long tail, and ad group two and three capitalizing on strong keywords that are valuable to you.

## What about poor quality traffic?

The broad match keyword in ad group one is going to attract a lot of different search queries, many of which might be irrelevant to your campaign. You need to monitor for these, and add them as negatives when they appear. For example, imagine our advertiser specializes in financial planning but not divorce. When your broad match keyword generates traffic you don't want, add it as another negative. Like this:

*   **Ad group one**: family lawyer -[family lawyer] -[divorce law]
*   **Ad group two**: [family lawyer]
*   **Ad group three**: "family lawyer"

Now you're beginning to sculpt your long tail traffic, while optimizing ad copy and landing pages for your valuable keywords.

## What happens when I find a high quality keyword?

The broad match keyword in ad group one is meant to generate traffic through long tail keywords. Some of these might turn out to be extremely valuable. When that happens, you first create additional ad groups that use these new, valuable keywords:

*   **Ad group one**: family lawyer -[family lawyer] -[divorce law]
*   **Ad group two**: [family lawyer]
*   **Ad group three**: "family lawyer"
*   **Ad group two**: [estate lawyer]
*   **Ad group three**: "estate lawyer"

And then you add these keywords as negatives to your long tail ad group. This ensures this keyword will trigger in your new, hyper-optimized ad group instead of the more broad long tail ad group:

*   **Ad group one**: family lawyer -[family lawyer] -[divorce law] -[estate lawyer]
*   **Ad group two**: [family lawyer]
*   **Ad group three**: "family lawyer"
*   **Ad group two**: [estate lawyer]
*   **Ad group three**: "estate lawyer"

## Another use for embedded negatives

Embedded negatives are also powerful for advertisers that want traffic _related_ to a topic, but not necessarily about the topic specifically. For example, if you are selling iPhone accessories, you might want traffic related to "iPhone case" or "iPhone stand" but not for "iPhone" itself. The embedded negative technique can help with this. Create an ad group like this: iphone -[iphone] And you will generate traffic that is related to the iphone, but not queries for the iphone itself.
