title: 'Hi, I''m Chris'
intro: |
  <img style="float: right; max-width: 200px;  border-radius: 50%;" src="/img/home/Chris_Headshot.jpg">I've managed marketing and product for more than 15 years, mostly for B2B software and telecommunications products. I co-founded Adfury, a SaaS platform for optimizing search advertising. This site is my second brain for digital marketing reference and a collection of various thoughts. 
  
  A bit more about this site is [here](/about).
  
  If you enjoy the technical aspects of marketing, this might be helpful. If you don't, [get in touch](mailto:chris@generalgrowthanalytics.com) and I might be able to do it for you.
