These extensions are described below -

### Sitelink extensions

Sitelinks are links with (optionally) up to 25 characters of of descriptive text. They are typically used to highlight different parts of your web site that users might find relevant, such as business hours or a product description page. - ![](https://blog.adfury.io/wp-content/uploads/SiteLinkExtensions.png) -

#### Why to consider using sitelinks

Sitelinks are good tools to increase general traffic, so if you have a broad campaign they can improve the volume of leads you receive. - They are a easy way to advertise time limited specials of seasonal offerings. You can update the sitelinks and easily add them to existing campaigns. You can schedule when sitelinks will show, so you can set them to come down as soon as the special is over. - They can help you better understand and target your audience. You can break down click through statistics and compare them to other sitelinks and to the headline of the ad. -

#### When to consider against sitelinks

If you are running a tightly targeted campaign you might consider avoiding sitelinks in favor of a complete focus on a single call to action. Additional links might distract from your primary call to action. If you’re not sure, it’s a good idea to test how sitelinks perform. -

### Callout extensions

Callouts are like bullet points in your ad. You can create as many callouts as you wish (at least three is recommended), and Google will show between none and six of them. How does Google determine when and how many extensions to show? They aren’t telling. You can use up to 25 characters to create a callout, but it’s better to keep it short -- about half that is best. - ![](https://blog.adfury.io/wp-content/uploads/CallOutExtension.png) - Examples of callout extensions include: Spanish speaking, Proudly serving 25yrs, No service fees, Money back guarantee, Free Cancellation, 24/7 customer service, Best price guarantee -

#### When to consider using callout extensions

Callouts are great for highlighting differentiators or unique offers, such as 24 hour service or multi-lingual support. They can help customers understand why your business is better than the competition. -

#### When to consider against callout extensions

There’s no reason not to use callouts. The space is available in your ad, you might as well use it. Keep them short, don’t Capitalize Every Word, and give some consideration to what you offer that’s really useful and relevant. -

### Call extensions

Call extensions let you add phone numbers to your ads. Especially on mobile devices, where people can simply click to call your business, they can significantly increase clickthrough rates. - ![](https://blog.adfury.io/wp-content/uploads/CallExtension.png) -

#### When to consider using call extensions

Adding a number for people to click-to-call can significantly improve the performance of your ad. Be careful using them, because fielding calls is expensive and time consuming. You might not want to include call extensions for support-related searches, for example, or for searches designed to capture leads early in the funnel. - You should take special care to use call extensions with mobile campaigns, including consideration for a “call only” campaign, which shows a phone number instead of a link. - Note that phone numbers are trackable as conversions just as web sites are. Set up call conversion tracking to ensure you are able to monitor performance end to end. -

#### When to consider against call extensions

You might not use call extensions for keywords designed to gather people early in the lead funnel. These people might not be ready to buy, and engaging them in a phone call uses significant resources with low ROI. - It might be obvious, but call extensions aren’t a good idea if you don’t have the resources to engage incoming calls promptly and professionally. You can set up a schedule for your ad so that it shows only when you have people available to receive the call. -

### Message extensions

Message extensions are a new type of extension that are being rolled out to accounts beginning in the fall of 2016\. They’re only available on mobile devices, and let people click the ad to send a text message. You can pre-define a message for your customers such as “I’m interested in scheduling an appointment”. - ![](https://blog.adfury.io/wp-content/uploads/MessageExtensions.png) -

#### When to consider using message extensions

Adding a number for people to click-to-call can significantly improve the performance of your ad. Be careful using them, because fielding calls is expensive and time consuming. You might not want to include call extensions for support-related searches, for example, or for searches designed to capture leads early in the funnel. - You should take special care to use call extensions with mobile campaigns, including consideration for a “call only” campaign, which shows a phone number instead of a link. - Note that phone numbers are trackable as conversions just as web sites are. Set up call conversion tracking to ensure you are able to monitor performance end to end. -

#### When to consider against message extensions

Message extensions work well for some services companies, but might not be appropriate for some B2B companies or for lead generation campaigns. - Just as with call extensions, make sure you have resources available to answer incoming messages. You can set up a schedule for your ad so that the message extension appears only when you have people available to receive and respond to it. -

### Location extensions

A location extension shows a physical address of your business. People can use it to find your business address, directions to your business, or to measure how close or far your business is relative to them. Similar to a call extension, locations may also include a phone number that can call your business with one click. - ![](https://blog.adfury.io/wp-content/uploads/LocationExtension.png) -

#### When to consider using location extensions

Location extensions encourage people to visit your business. If you have a brick and mortar location, you should consider using location extensions. Be sure and coordinate your location targeting to location extensions. It might not be useful to show your location if the user is searching from another part of the country. -

#### When to consider against location extensions

You should consider whether it’ll be helpful to show location extensions to people that are physically distant from your location. Consider setting up multiple campaigns, with location extensions used with those campaigns with location targeting proximate to your location. - Some businesses do not serve people through physical locations (Google itself is an example). Such businesses should not include location extensions in their advertising. -

### Review extensions

Review extensions provide an additional line of text underneath your ad that can be used to highlight third party reviews of your business. They must be about your business as a whole, not just about a single product or service. - ![](https://blog.adfury.io/wp-content/uploads/ReviewExtension.png) -

#### Why to consider using review extensions

Data shows that “social proof” -- examples of other people that were happy with service -- is a powerful motivator for potential customers. Review extensions let you include social proof directly in your ad by sharing rankings, reviews, and positive mentions. -

#### When to consider against review extensions

Review extensions are great, and you should use them if you can. But using them isn’t a matter of adding a nice quote to your ad. The reviews must be submitted to Google for approval. Google’s guidelines for review extensions is available here. According to Google’s rules, the review must be “an accurate, current, credible, non-duplicative third-party review of the advertiser’s business.” -

### App extensions

Just as the name implies, App extensions allow you to link to your mobile or tablet app from your text ads. When people click on the app extension link, they download your app. - ![](https://blog.adfury.io/wp-content/uploads/AppExtension.png) -

#### Why to consider using app extensions

If you have an app, the App extensions are a great way to provide access to your website and your app from a single ad. - Similar to calls, app downloads are trackable as conversions just as web sites are. Set up iOS and Android conversion tracking to ensure you are able to monitor performance end to end. -

#### When to consider against app extensions

Not surprisingly, if you don’t have an app you should not include app extensions in your advertising. 

### How to choose which extensions to use

Keep these best practices in mind as you choose and set up your extensions: -

*   Use every extension relevant to your business—extensions are free to add and they’ll only show if they’re predicted to improve your performance. For more information on when extensions show, see About extensions.

*   Consider adding 4 or more extensions. For example, you could add sitelinks, callouts, structured snippets, and one additional extension of your choice.

*   If it makes sense for your business, create extensions at higher account levels (for example, at the account or campaign level, when available).

Select your extensions based on your primary advertising goal. Here are common advertiser goals and the extensions that can support them: -   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
