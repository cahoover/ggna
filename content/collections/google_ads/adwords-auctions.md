AdWords performs an auction every time someone does a search. These auctions are a little different than you may expect. Usually, winning an auction is as simple as offering the highest bid. On AdWords, however, bidding is not the most important factor in selecting a winner.

So, how exactly do you win an auction? As always, it begins with a search. Say someone is interested in learning nursing near Raleigh, North Carolina, so she Googles “nursing schools in Raleigh.” 

AdWords quickly determines which ads are relevant to this query. It then narrows the list of ads down by calculating a Quality Score, which is based on:

*   keyword and ad click through rate (CTR)
*   relevance of the keyword to its ad
*   relevance and quality of your ad text
*   landing page quality and relevance
*   historical AdWords account performance

Ads with very low Quality Scores are not displayed at all, regardless of the advertiser’s bid. AdWords eliminates those ads and then continues the auction.

### Ad Position

Ads appear either above the organic search results or below them. Ads on the top tend to perform better than those on the bottom, and those on the first page perform better than those on subsequent pages. According to a recent study by Chitika, the top ad receives 33 percent of all traffic, while the top three ads together receive 60 percent. Thus the higher you can get your ad to appear, the more good it will do your company.

The most reliable way to improve ad rank is to raise your quality score. By selecting and prominently including effective keywords, filtering out irrelevant searches with negative keywords, and writing compelling ad and landing page copy, you can raise your quality score and thus achieve a higher position. Increasing your bid can also raise your rank, but it’s no substitute for a good quality score.

### How AdWords determines ad position

Google doesn't advertise how they determine position, but endless study has discovered the general principles. AdWords multiplies Quality Score by the keyword’s Maximum Cost-Per-Click (CPC) bid (pre-set by the advertiser) to calculate an “Ad Rank.”

The bidder with the highest Ad Rank wins first place in the auction, and the ad is displayed in the first ad position on Google’s Search Engine Results Page (SERP). Lower ranked ads are displayed in descending order. 

The formula looks like this: Ad Rank = f(Quality Score, Max CPC bid)

### How AdWords determines cost

Finally, AdWords determines the amount each user must pay per click, or cost per click (CPC). Adwords does this by using a formula called the AdWords Discounter. The Maximum CPC bid indicates the most you will pay for a click, but the actual CPC is often lower.

Here is the AdWords Discounter formula: Ad Rank of Competitor Below You ÷ Your Quality Score + 1 cent = Actual Cost Per Click 

Let’s use an example to better understand this. You won the AdWords auction. Your keyword has a Max CPC bid of $0.80 and a Quality Score of 8. The advertiser in second place has an Ad Rank of 5.25.

The formula to calculate your actual cost per click in this scenario looks like this: 5.25 ÷ 8 + .01 = $0.67 So, even if your Max CPC bid is $0.80, you pay $0.67 for the top ad position. The formula is applied to all advertisers.
