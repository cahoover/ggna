intro: |
  I'm a long time marketer, mostly for technical B2B products. I also co-founded Adfury, a SaaS platform for optimizing search advertising. This site is mostly a collection of how-tos for digital marketing.
  
  If you enjoy the technical aspects of marketing, this might be helpful. If you don't, [get in touch](mailto:chris@generalgrowthanalytics.com) and I'll do it for you.

When I first started consulting, I figured the work would be similar to my experience in-house. I thought I would help with marketing strategy, just with more variety. 

What I didn't count on was that my clients didn't have in-house expertise or bandwidth to execute a strategy. It was up to me to get shit done, and everything needed to be measured, tested, evaluated, and iterated. 

The result was a lot of learning curves. How to audit sites for SEO, to optimize PPC campaigns, to evaluate reviews using natural language processing, to conduct sentiment analysis on social networks, perform A/B testing on landing pages, configure Google Tag Manager and Analytics, and on and on. 

And while there are many excellent resources for learning available, there was no single place that tied things together. Over time I had extensive notes, which I'm moving online. Hopefully it'll be helpful.
