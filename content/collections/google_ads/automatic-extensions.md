Automatic Ad Extensions, which are sometimes called annotations, are extensions that Google automatically includes with your ad. Google builds these extensions by grabbing bits of information from your web site and various other sources, such as reviews.

### Recommendation: In most cases, opt out

Google has good intentions with automatic extensions -- in general extensions help your ad perform better. But automated text can be unpredictable and can conflict with your intended messaging (and you definitely don’t want a bad review amended to your ad!). For this reason we recommend that you opt out of automatic extensions and use manual extensions instead. One way to do this is to set up the manual equivalent of the automated extension. For example, if you set up a manual site link extension or review extension, they will be used in lieu of the automated equivalent. A second way to avoid automated extensions is to opt out. At one time you had to opt out from each extension individually using a specific form. AdWords was recently updated and you can disable automated ad extensions directly from the AdWords interface, following these steps:

1.  Sign into your AdWords account.
2.  Click the **Ad extensions** tab.
3.  Click the “View” dropdown and select **Automated extensions report.**
4.  Click **Automated extension options (advanced)**.
5.  Click **Edit** next to “Show all automated extensions for this account”.
6.  Click **Exclude specific automated extensions for this account**.
7.  Check the box next to the automated extension you’d like to disable.
8.  Click **Save**.

### Consumer ratings extensions

### Seller Ratings Extensions

Similar to review extensions, seller rating extensions provide user ratings of your business of between one and five stars. The ratings come from Google’s trusted review sources like (Google Trusted Stores,StellaService, and Google Consumer Surveys) ![](https://blog.adfury.io/wp-content/uploads/CustomerScore.png)  

### Dynamic Sitelink Extensions

These are similar to the manual sitelink extensions, just automatically generated. The best way to opt out of these is to create manual extensions yourself. ![](https://blog.adfury.io/wp-content/uploads/AutomatedSiteLink.png)
