  In Google Ads, ads and keywords are grouped together into ad groups. Ad groups are in turn grouped together into campaigns, which can themselves be grouped. You set your budget, device and location targeting at the campaign level. 
  
  All this allows you to organize your advertising account so that you can allocate budget around campaigns that target your most valuable customers, and simultaneously ensure your ads perform their best by coordinating keywords, ad copy, and landing pages.

Advertising works best when it is specific and targeted. The more general and vague the ad, the worse it is likely to perform. So you want to organize your campaign so that it’s easy to build targeted, specific, advertising that makes sense for your budget.

## Considerations for organizing campaigns

There is no iron law for campaign organization, but there are some good rules of thumb to be aware of.

### Create separate campaigns for products with different ROI

Think about your business from a high level. What kind of customers are most valuable to your business? Which kind of customers are second most valuable? Third most? There’s no rule to follow. Each business is different. Some might focus on delivering high volume but inexpensive services. For others it’s the opposite. Whatever the answer for your business, grouping your products or services by value is a good first step to creating a campaign organization strategy. You create a different campaign for each segment. Because your advertising budget is set by campaign, this allows you to allocate your overall ad spend so that it appropriately reflects your business strategy.

### Create separate campaigns for mobile and desktop

Google Ads allows you to make bid-adjustments based on device. This means you can instruct Google Ads to increase (or decrease) your base bid by a certain amount depending on whether the searcher is using a mobile device or a desktop PC. Consider creating a campaign with a -100% mobile bid adjustment, and a second campaign with a -100% desktop and tablet bid adjustment. The first campaign reduces your mobile bid to nothing, so you ads will appear only on tablets and desktops. In the second campaign, ads will appear only on mobile (non-tablet) devices. 

(I have found that using a single campaign for both tablets and desktops works well for most advertisers, and it’s easier to manage. Feel free to create a third campaign for tablets if you like.)

Separating campaigns by device allows you to build ads with mobile friendly features (such as ads with phone numbers) as well as ads with desktop friendle features (such as forms) and keep everything organized.

### Group similar locations in separate campaigns

Google lets you target your campaigns to specific areas. The recommended strategy is to define campaigns with specific location targets such as zip code, then create ad groups for each neighborhood in the zip code. Within each ad group, place keywords for that neighborhood.

## Considerations for organizing ad groups

Ideally, each campaign should be organized tightly around its keywords, meaning you should only use so many keywords for any given ad group. The more keywords you include, the harder it is to use them all in your ads or landing pages, reducing relevance and harming your overall Quality Score. 

To determine if your keywords are organized tightly enough, ask if any two terms in the same ad group could be logically separated. “Florida condos” and “houses in Florida,” for example, refer to different types of properties, and thus may belong in separate groups; “Florida condos” and “condos in Florida,” on the other hand, are essentially the same. 

Because you can create as many ad groups as you want with no additional cost, you should try to use as few logically distinct keywords as possible for each ad. You can even create an ad group for each keyword. While this requires more effort, it can improve your relevance and thus your revenues. 

## How many keywords?

Google suggest no more than 5-20 keywords per ad group, but it’s a best practice to focus on the lower end of that range. Or even lower --  the idea of “SKAGs,” an acronym that stands for “single keyword ad group” is the logical extreme of this philosophy. Not many people use SKAGs because it means writing more ads, but it’s the best way to ensure maximum relevance.

## Experiment loosely, focus tightly

If you aren’t sure if a particular keyword is going to be strong for your campaign, place it as a broad modified match keyword into an ad group with a few other uncertain keywords. After the campaign has been live for a week or two, you’ll start to understand better which of those keywords are more important for your business. Place those as exact match keywords into their own ad group. 

For example, if you are advertising a mechanic service, you might separate keywords related to auto body work from those related to repair work. In this way you can more easily tailor your overall experience to match the customer’s needs.
