AdWords performance doesn't have to be a mystery or a chore. There's some steps you can build into a routine that will help ensure your campaigns continue humming along. -

### Weekly sanity check

The market is large and moves fast, so it’s a good idea to check in with your campaigns every week or so to make sure that nothing has gone off the rails (and to fix anything that has). You don’t have to go crazy and check every hour -- or even every day -- but make it a habit to drop by on a particular day every month. -

#### Monitor overall impression share

Impression share is the frequency your ad was displayed when someone searched for your keyword. For example, if you have a 80% impression share, it means that your ad was displayed 80% of the time when someone in your location target searched for your keyword. - Impression share is helpful to follow because a drop in impressions is a flag that something is wrong with your campaign and a closer look is warranted. If your impressions drop you should take a look at your bid strategy (if you are under bidding, your ad will not be displayed), your budget (if you run out of budget, your ad will not be displayed), and your ad rank. - **If your impression share is low because you ran out of budget** should you increase your budget? If you’re getting profitable traffic and a strong conversion rate, the additional return might justify more investment. If the campaign isn’t profitable, or is marginally profitable, raising your budget is not a good investment. Test and iterate your campaign until profitable, and then look into additional budget. - **If your impression share is low because you are appearing low in search results** should you increase your budget? No! All you are doing is increasing the number of times your ad appeared in a poor position in search results. Instead you need to make sure your bids are high enough to place your ads in a first page position. You should also check that your Quality Score isn’t dragging down your placement. -

#### Monitor your keyword performance

Keywords are either performing well or they are not, and their status changes over time. You can’t depend on a high performing keyword to continue performing well indefinitely. Things change. Search patterns change, slang terms are introduced, whatever the reason it’s a good idea to keep tabs on your keyword performance. - To test a keyword, take a look at its impressions. If your keyword isn’t generating any impressions, you’re wasting your time writing better ads or updating your landing pages. Figure out why you’re getting poor impressions for that keyword, with particular attention paid to the Quality Score. A low Quality Score on one keyword can impact all the ads in your Ad Group, so you want to get rid of low QS ads, place them in their own Ad Group, and adjust ad copy and the landing page to maximize relevance. -

#### Check your CTR

Once you are satisfied that your keyword is generating views of your ad, you want to check if people are clicking on that ad. People won’t click on ads that they don’t think are relevant, don’t offer anything interesting, or that they don’t see because they are too far down the page. If you have a low CTR, you should take a look at the ad and make sure that the copy is both relevant to the search and has something meaningful and differentiated to say. If you have a low rank, take a look at your bids and make sure they are sufficient for a good position. -

#### Check your conversions

Once you are satisfied that your ad is generating enough clicks, take a look at your conversion rate. The conversion rate is where your investment in AdWords generates return. If you have a strong impression share and solid CTR with low conversions, you’re not accomplishing much more than sending money to Google with best wishes. Low conversions means that the ad was relevant to the search, but the landing page didn’t fulfill the promise of the ad. You need to adjust one or the other to better align the promise with the delivery. -

#### Check your profit

Congratulations! Your keywords are delivering impressions, your impressions are delivering clicks, your clicks are delivering conversions. Are those conversions delivering value to your company? You need to track your conversions by setting up conversion tracking (described later in this book) and monitoring the value of the conversions over time. Imagine that you make $200 profit for every sale. If you are paying $10 per click and have a 4% conversion rate, you are losing $50 for every sale. (A 4% conversion rate is 2 conversions out of every 50 clicks, or $400 profit for $500 in ad spend) -

### Bi-monthly tune-up activity

Once every month or two it’s a good idea to go over the details of your campaigns and make sure that everything is chugging along the way that it should. -

#### Check traffic by device

Take a look at your traffic by device. If everything is performing equally well relative to device, great. If one device is performing significantly better or worse than the other, you should split them into different campaigns. -

#### Check search terms

Your broad match and phrase match keywords will be triggered for many different search terms. Periodically take a look at these terms to see if any should be embraced more closely or rejected altogether. - Terms to embrace more closely are those that are profitable and can perform even better for you if they were exact match keywords with tailored ad copy and landing pages. Finding profitable search terms and creating exact match keywords can lower your cost (bidding on exact match keywords tends to be lower) and can generate higher profits because you’re creating a traffic profile that’s more likely to convert. -

#### Check geographic performance

A common mistake in AdWords is not setting location targeting, and running campaigns globally. It’s rare that a single campaign is truly global, with profitable appeal in countries from Afghanistan to Zambia. - Even if your campaigns are carefully targeted to select locations, monitor performance across those locations. Check that the conversion rate and profitability continue to make sense for the budget and bidding you have applied to the campaign. -

#### Check time range performance

Take a look at time of day reports to understand how your ads are performing throughout the day. You might have a drop in conversions during various time periods and might consider lowering your bids during those times and reinvest that budget into better performing times. - Make it a habit to check time trends regularly, because what what was once true may have changed.
