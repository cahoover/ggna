intro: |
  When I first started consulting, I figured the work would be similar to my experience in-house: I would help with marketing strategy, just with more variety. 
  
  But my clients also needed help executing. I had to get shit done, and everything needed to be measured, tested, evaluated, and iterated. 
  
  The result was a lot of learning curves. How to audit sites for SEO, to optimize PPC campaigns, to evaluate reviews using natural language processing, to conduct sentiment analysis on social networks, perform A/B testing on landing pages, configure Google Tag Manager and Analytics, and on and on. 
  
  Over time I had extensive notes, which I'm moving online. Hopefully it'll be helpful.
