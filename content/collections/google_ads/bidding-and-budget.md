Whenever anyone searches on Google, AdWords performs a digital auction to decide which ads will appear in the results. Unlike typical auctions, bidding alone does not determine the winner; your Quality Score also plays an important role. Nonetheless, bidding does affect campaign results and costs, so choose your bid with care.

### Bidding terms

Here are the basics you should understand:

*   Quality Score- As we discussed in a previous section, this score measures the quality of your ads based on relevance, keyword use, landing page content, and other factors.
*   Maximum Cost-Per-Click- This is the most you are willing to pay for each click.
*   Default Bid- This refers to the maximum sum you will pay for each click on keywords in an ad group. AdWords sets this bid on its own, but you can override this and put specific bids on individual keywords.
*   Minimum Bid- This is the least amount of money you must pay to be included in an auction. The higher your quality score, the lower the minimum bid.

### Bidding in depth

For each search, Google AdWords identifies all the ads with matching keywords. It multiplies each ad’s quality score by the maximum cost-per-click that the advertiser has set. The product is known as the “ad rank” score, and it determines if and where a search result will appear. To better understand how ad rank works, consider the following four advertisers: Ad Rank = Quality Score * Max CPC bid For example, consider four advertisers:

**Advertiser 1**  Bid: $10,  Quality Score: 1, Ad Rank: Ad not displayed
**Advertiser 2**  Bid: $4,  Quality Score: 2, Ad Rank score: 8 
**Advertiser 3**  Bid: $2,  Quality Score: 6, Ad Rank score: 12 (first place) 
**Advertiser 4**  Bid: $1,  Quality Score: 9, Ad Rank score: 9

Notice that Advertiser 1 had such a low quality score that their ad was not displayed at all, even though they bid the most! Likewise, even though Advertiser 3 had the third-lowest bid, its ad reached first place thanks to a high quality score.

### Cost considerations

The maximum CPC you set usually is not the actual amount of money you have to pay. Instead, Google bases your price off the ad that ranks immediately below you. It divides that ad’s rank by your quality score and then adds one cent; this is the cost you will pay for each click. Let’s say you have a quality score of 8 and the ad immediately below you has a rank of 5.25\. AdWords divides 5.25 by 8 to get 0.66\. It then ads 0.1 to produce 0.67\. Your cost per click will thus be $0.67.

### Choosing a bid

Before you make a budget and decide how much to bid, it’s important to consider the your campaign's goals. Setting goals allows you to determine how much to bid on each ad. To do this, ask the following questions:

*   Am I trying to maximize my product's exposure? If so, you should bid to maximize the number of people who view your ad.
*   Do I want to drive more traffic to the landing page? This entails getting a large volume of users to click on your ad; the specific type of users is less important.
*   Am I trying to get more leads? If you’re looking to identify likely customers, you should focus less on the amount of traffic you receive and more on the quality of that traffic.

### Measuring your bids

Once you know the goals for your ads, you can choose metrics to measure them. Examples include:

*   Increase branding by driving lots of impressions while staying under a target CPM.
*   Increase site traffic by driving lots of clicks while staying under a target CPC.
*   Increase leads by driving conversions while staying below a maximum CPA.
*   Increase sales by driving conversions with a positive ROI.

### Bid adjustments

You can adjust your bid up or down by a percentage to show your ad more or less frequently for searches that are done under certain circumstances. For the Google Search network, bid adjustments are available for:

#### Device

Device bid adjustments let you show your ad more or less frequently depending on whether the user is on a mobile phone, a tablet, or a desktop computer. You can opt out of a device completely by decreasing your bid by 100% for that device. This enables you to create a campaign that’s mobile-specific, for example.

#### Location

Location bid adjustments let you show your ad more or less frequently to people depending on where they are physically located. For example, you might want to increase a bid for someone physically located near your business.

#### Schedule

Schedule bid adjustments let you show your ad more or less frequently depending on the time of day. For example, you might want to increase your bids during those times of day when people are more likely searching for your services.

#### Match type

Match type bid adjustments let you show your ad more or less frequently depending on the match type that triggered your keyword. For example, you may be running broad modified keywords to research queries and exact match keywords to deliver leads. You can adjust bids up or down for these match types to increase or decrease investment depending on the needs of your business.
