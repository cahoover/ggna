When I first started consulting as a "virtual CMO," I figured the work would be similar to my experience as salaried executive. I imagined that I would help companies define and implement growth strategy, with the added benefit of greater variety and more flexibility. 

What I didn't count on was that more often that not I was expected to /execute/ the strategy as well. My clients didn't have in-house expertise or bandwidth. 

And execution meant lots of analytics. Branding, positoning, messaging, and creative were as important as ever, but it was clear that data science provided the foundation. Everything needed to be measured, tested, evaluated, and iterated. 

The result was working through a lot of learning curves. I couldn't rely on a team -- I needed to myself learn how to audit sites for SEO, to optimize PPC campaigns, to evaluate reviews using natural language processing, to conduct sentiment analysis on social networks, perform A/B testing on landing pages, configure Google Tag Manager and Analytics, and more. 

And while there are many excellent resources for learning available, I am prone to over-compliating things, especially with a wealth of information.

I found that there was no single place that tied things together -- that provided an actionable survey of modern marketing from building a team, to building a brand, to building a dashboard.

So I decided to create one, because organizing these disparate ideas made things less overwhelming for me. Hopefully it'll help others, too.
