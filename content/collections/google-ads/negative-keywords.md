Succeeding with AdWords isn’t just about bringing in the right searchers; it’s also about keeping the wrong searchers off your site. Often, the same word can refer to radically different ideas, linking your business to unrelated topics. Searches with similar keywords but different meanings will increase the number of people who are not searching for your product but see your ad anyway, harming your relevance. Negative keywords allow you to filter these searches out, ensuring that the only people who see your site are those who can use it. Let’s say you use the phrase “securities broker” as a keyword. “Broker” is a generic term referring to anyone who organizes a transaction. People searching for real estate brokers, auto brokers, and a wide range of other topics may thus see your site. If you enter “real estate” and “auto” under negative keywords, you filter out users looking for these other types of brokers.

### Types of negatives

You can create negative keywords using the same match type as with regular keywords. If you're unclear about match types, you can [learn more about match types](https://blog.adfury.io/blog/adwords-match-type/). The match types work a little differently than the standard match type. Examples are provided below. An important difference is that when you create a negative keyword, Google will not automatically negative match synonyms, singular/plural versions, misspellings, or close variants of the keyword. You need to add these as separate negative keywords.

#### Negative broad

The default for negative keywords. If the search query contains all your negative keywords (regardless of order) the ad will not run. _Synonyms, misspellings and plural variants will trigger the ad_. If you are negative matching **real estate**,

*   <span style="color: #99cc00;">**Estate sale** will trigger an ad</span>
*   <span style="color: #99cc00;">**Real estates** will trigger an ad</span>
*   <span style="color: #99cc00;">**Real estatess** will trigger an ad</span>
*   <span style="color: #ff0000;">**Texas real estate** will not trigger an ad</span>
*   <span style="color: #ff0000;">**Estate real** will not trigger an ad</span>
*   <span style="color: #ff0000;">**Real estate** will not trigger an ad</span>

####  Negative phrase

If the search query contains all your negative keywords in the same order, the ad will not run. _Synonyms, misspellings and plural variants will trigger the ad_. If you are negative matching "**real estate**"

*   <span style="color: #99cc00;">**Estate sale** will trigger an ad</span>
*   <span style="color: #99cc00;">**Real estates** will trigger an ad</span>
*   <span style="color: #99cc00;">**Real estatess** will trigger an ad</span>
*   <span style="color: #ff0000;">**Texas real estate** will not trigger an ad</span>
*   <span style="color: #99cc00;">**Estate real** will trigger an ad</span>
*   <span style="color: #ff0000;">**Real estate** will not trigger an ad</span>

#### Negative exact

If the search query contains the exact negative keyword, and only the keyword, in the same order, the ad will not run. _Synonyms, misspellings and plural variants will trigger the ad_. If you are negative matching **[real estate]**

*   <span style="color: #99cc00;">**Estate sale** will trigger an ad</span>
*   <span style="color: #99cc00;">**Real estates** will trigger an ad</span>
*   <span style="color: #99cc00;">**Real estatess** will trigger an ad</span>
*   <span style="color: #99cc00;">**Texas real estate** will trigger an ad</span>
*   <span style="color: #99cc00;">**Estate real** will trigger an ad</span>
*   <span style="color: #ff0000;">**Real estate** will not trigger an ad</span>

### Embedded negatives

Here's a trick not too many people are aware of. You can combine negative keywords with broad match keywords to fine tune your campaigns. This little-known technique lets you focus your ads in clever ways. For example, imagine that you sell iPhone accessories. You can include negative exact match **[iphone] **and broad modified **+iphone** simultaneously.

*   <span style="color: #ff0000;">**iphone** will not trigger an ad</span>
*   <span style="color: #99cc00;">**iphone cases** will trigger an ad</span>
*   <span style="color: #99cc00;">**iphone repair** will trigger an ad</span>

### Campaign-wide negatives

There are many negative keywords that any advertiser should consider using when putting together a campaign. These include references to adult material, obscenities, the word “free,” the word “facebook,” the word “mp3,” the word “video,” the word “funny,” and many others. The AdFury campaign launcher automatically generates a list of common negative keywords when you create a campaign. It's a great starting point and makes it easy to add or remove negative keywords with the peace of mind that you've covered the basics.

### Finding strategic negatives

Beyond the obvious examples, you must also think strategically about how to use negative keywords in your particular campaign. Here are some techniques:

*   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consider Other Uses</span>: Imagine you are advertising real estate services. Terms like “agency,” “broker,” “commercial,” “residential,” and “investment” are all relevant to real estate, but also appear in unrelated contexts. For example, one may associate “Residential” with residential cleaning company; likewise, you may associate “commercial” with commercial banking. Think of as many possible uses of these terms as you can, and enter the ones that aren’t relevant to you as exact match negative keywords.
*   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Check Your Search Query Report</span>: You don't have to think of everything. Let Google do the work. Once your campaign gets going, take a look at the search queries that are triggering your ads. Look for searches that are not related, and develop negative keywords to prevent them from recurring.
*   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specify Locations</span>-Negative keywords allow you to filter out distant locations that have names similar to the ones where that you want to target. If you service Virginia but not West Virginia, for example, enter “West” and “WV” as negative keywords. Likewise, if you have a Washington State based business, “DC” should be a negative keyword.
*   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Look Up Terms</span>- Using Google searches, a thesaurus, or anything else that will identify related words, look for terms associated with the keywords you use. Any that are not relevant to your business should be entered as negative keywords.

In addition to preventing wholly irrelevant searches, block searches from people who may be using search terms similar to your keywords, but aren’t likely to click on your ads. For example, if your business services a niche audience, then searches from a more general demographic are likely to ignore your ads. When searchers ignore your ads, it harms your click-through-rate (or CTR), a measure of how frequently people select your ad relative to how often it appears in results. A low CTR can impact your quality score, which will lead to higher costs. The better you target your ads to likely buyers, the higher your quality score will be.

### Negative keyword cautions

There are some rules of thumb to keep in mind when using negative keywords.

*   Google will not automatically negative match synonyms, singular/plural versions, misspellings, or close variants of the keyword. You need to add these as separate negative keywords.
*   Google will not process negative keywords that appear after the 10th word in a search query. If the search query is very long, say **inexpensive miami north beach two bedroom modern close to beach real estate**, the ad will be triggered even if you included **real estate** as a negative keyword.
*   Negative keywords will throttle your traffic. Be careful not to suffocate your campaign with too many of them.
