Conversion tracking is one of the most important metrics for lead generation marketers. When a user performs a desired action, such as submitting their name and email address or making a call, it’s called a conversion. Conversions are the name of the game in lead generation advertising. Google provides an easy way to track conversions, cleverly called conversion tracking. In lead generation campaigns, a conversion means a user engaged the company by making a call or submitting contact information.

### How conversion tracking works

When a user clicks on an ad, Google stores a bit of information in the user’s browser. This bit of information is called a cookie. It’s a record of the most recent keyword used and the most recent ad clicked. After clicking the ad (and updating the cookie), the user arrives at a web page. A special bit of code on the web page (a conversion tracker) reports the arrival back to Google, which records a conversion. The conversion tracker reflects the information in the cookie, so that Google also records which search and which ad triggered the conversion.

### Call and app tracking

Although conversion tracking is often thought of in the context of a web site, calls and app downloads can be tracked as conversions as well. For call tracking, Google provides special numbers called forwarding numbers. When someone clicks the call icon on your ad, the number doesn’t call you, it calls Google. Google records the conversion and immediately forwards the call to you. The process is very fast, so that users don’t experience an unusual wait when calling forwarding numbers.

### Conversion tracking options

The cookie stored on a user’s browser after they click on an ad is good for 30 days. It’s possible that the user will return to the web page with the conversion code during that time. The conversion code will see the cookie and dutifully report back to Google. Should Google record a second conversion? You get to choose. There are three options ; one per click, many per click, and view-through.

#### One per click

This option means that every subsequent visit during the 30 day life of the cookie is not recorded as additional conversions. One per click is the most commonly used and usually the best way to track performance for lead generation campaigns.

#### Many per click

This option means that every subsequent visit during the 30 day life of the cookie is recorded as an additional conversion. For lead generation campaigns this option can skew measurements of conversion cost and rates and is not recommended.

#### View-Through Conversions

This option is relevant only to ads on the Display Network, and is therefore out of scope for this book.

### Consent

Google’s privacy rules require that users be informed when a conversion tracker is being used to report their behavior. Make sure you follow these rules by including language in your privacy policy about the use of tracking codes, and provide a link to the policy in your landing page. Google takes this privacy rule seriously. Which means you should, too. Have your privacy policy language reviewed by a lawyer to make sure you are in the clear.

### Conversion value

Google allows you to place a value on the conversion, which can be very helpful in measuring the return on your advertising investment.
