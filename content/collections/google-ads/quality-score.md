A bit of background. For Google, high quality search results is everything. Their business depends on delivering search results that are relevant to the search and link to the best information. This is just as true for advertisements as it is for anything else that appears on a search results page. 

Quality Score is how Google measures the relevance of your ad **and the ad's landing page** in relation to the keywords that trigger it. (A "landing page" is the site the ad points to.) The less relevant your ad and landing page, the lower your Quality Score. If your Quality Score gets low enough, your ads won't run no matter how much you bid on them. A high Quality Score, on the other hand, will super-charge your campaign. Ads with higher Quality Scores have lower costs and higher ranking than their lower-quality competitors.

### How quality score is calculated

Quality Score ranges from 1 (the worst) to 10 (the best). If you have a good Quality Score, your ads will appear in better positions and will cost less.</span> ![](https://blog.adfury.io/wp-content/uploads/pexels-photo-186461.jpeg)Google keeps the exact Quality Score algorithm a secret, but many experiments have been run over the years that give us a good general picture of which factors go into it:

**Click through rate (CTR)** The click-through rate (CTR) is the ratio of ad clicks vs the number of times it was shown in search results. _The CTR is the most important factor in determining Quality Score_. In fact, for some time the CTR was the only factor that defined Quality Score. It’s not hard to understand why. Click through rate measures how often searchers themselves determine whether an ad is relevant to their search. Essentially, it’s a way for searchers to vote on the quality of your ad. If the ad isn’t relevant to a search, people don’t click on it.

**The quality of your landing page** Your ad might be brilliantly written and generate a high CTR, but it must also lead to a page that is itself relevant to the search. Google determines landing page relevance by scanning each landing page for keyword matches, thematic relevance, and even the time it took for the page to load. 

**Ad performance based on domain** Google considers the past performance of a landing page as well as the overall quality of the page. If you consistently achieve high Quality Scores for a keyword with a particular domain, that will impact your overall score. 

**Ad performance based on targets** Google considers how well your ad has performed in the geographic regions you are targeting, as well as on different types of devices.

**Ad copy that matches keywords** Google takes into account how closely your ad copy matches the keyword. You don’t necessarily have to have a verbatim match between ad copy and keyword, but they should be very closely related. For example, the words "cake" and "dessert" are closely related. But a keywords "online education" and "colleges" are quite different.

**Your account track record** Google considers the overall Quality Score of your account. A high performing campaign can be negatively (or positively) impacted by the CTRs of ads and keywords elsewhere in your account.  

### Improving Quality Score

To improve Quality Score, focus on making a campaign that is relevant to the searcher. Google wants to generate search results that are clear, relevant, and lead users to content that is itself relevant, useful, and easy to work with.
