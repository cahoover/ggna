Search advertising lets you show ads to people interested in your products and services, while avoiding folks who aren't. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only does it let you communicate with millions of potential customers, but it lets you select and track the users who have the most to gain from your site. This is indispensable for generating steady traffic.</span>

### High commercial intent

Paid search results generate a different kind of traffic. The volume is dramatically lower, but revenue impact of the traffic is much higher. In fact, over 60% of users with an intent to purchase click on PPC ads. This is true even when users are presented with a wide array of organic search results (see research from [Zero Gravity Marketing](http://zerogravitymarketing.com/how-many-people-click-ppc-ads/)). PPC traffic has a _high commercial intent_. This image was cleverly selected to visually communicate "high commercial intent": ![](https://blog.adfury.io/wp-content/uploads/money-card-business-credit-card-50987.jpeg)   On the other hand, information-seeking traffic is important to nurture future customers, but it doesn’t translate into immediate revenue. It has a low _commercial intent_. For example, we once managed a site that received more than a 100,000 unique monthly visitors from organic search results, but generated less than a thousand dollars in sales from that traffic. The organic traffic was important for attracting and engaging potential customers, but not so great for driving immediate revenue. A good marketing strategy should generate both types of traffic. A strong organic strategy builds long term trust, while a strong PPC strategy serves uses ready to buy. There are other good reasons to invest in search advertising.

### Immediate impact

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Paid search provides fast feedback. You can place a few ads and get performance data in days, eliminating those ads that perform poorly and tweaking strong performers to see if you can boost effectiveness even more. This process of testing and iteration is central to any AdWords strategy.</span>

### Cost control

You have complete control over your budget and can deliver effective results with modest investment if you carefully manage your campaigns. You set daily budgets, which represents the average amount you're willing to spend per day for your campaign. A good tip is to start small, perhaps a daily budget somewhere between $10 to $50\. Then you can monitor how your campaigns are performing and adjust your budget accordingly.

### Advertise only to interested people

The magic of search is that advertisements will appear only in response to specific searches. Although this doesn't guarantee that the searcher is actually interested in your company, it dramatically increases the odds in your favor. Traditional advertising has exactly the opposite ratio: the vast majority of impressions are made on people without the slightest interest in your product.

### Pay only for engagement

Traditional advertising charges for "impressions." That is, the number of people that are exposed to your ad. The problem with this method is that the vast majority of people upon whom you are making impressions don't care about your product. Large portions of your advertising budget is spent attempting to communicate to a void. Not so with search advertising, in which you pay only when some is interested enough in your business to click on the advertisement.  

### Measure results

Marketing pioneer John Wanamaker famously (perhaps apocryphally) observed that "Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which half." With conversion tracking, that's no longer true. You can monitor every aspect of your advertising, including the effectiveness of the advertisement in drawing "conversions" (a "conversion" is a desired action, such as a purchase). Not only does this enable you to iterate your advertising to achieve the most effective message, but you can use this information to improve all your other marketing efforts as well.
